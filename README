Graphos v0.01

NB: DON'T EVEN THINK OF USING THIS ON PRODUCTION, FOR NOW. WE'LL LET YOU KNOW AS COOKIES ARE FULLY BAKER

Graphos is a helper library for django to plot data into a live graph, fetching data from a modelfield or a redis list.

As of now, this is just a proof of concept design. Missing a lot of functional implementations a lot code refactoring.

HOW TO TRY
syncdb, runserver, and click on the add data to see the magic.
Or even, try POST to / with curl, and graph gets plotted automatically.

HACKING
More detailed documentation in HOWTO file on the same folder.
