Graphos v0.01

NB: DON'T EVEN THINK OF USING THIS ON PRODUCTION, FOR NOW. WE'LL LET YOU KNOW AS COOKIES ARE FULLY BAKED.

Graphos is a helper library for django to plot data into a live graph, fetching data from a modelfield or a redis list.

Just use a templatetag and specify which model you what to plot, and add jquery.js and jquery.plot.js to your base.html, you are done. You can tweak with extra options to the tag.

As of now, this is just a proof of concept design. Missing a lot of functional implementations a lot code refactoring.

HOW TO TRY
syncdb, runserver, and click on the add data to see the magic.
Or even, try POST to / with curl, and graph gets plotted automatically.

HACKING
More detailed documentation in HOWTO file on the same folder.

#TODO
- Support for redis lists on the way.
